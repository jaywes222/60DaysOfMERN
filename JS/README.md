####What is JavaScript and why is it used?

JavaScript is a programming language that helps make web pages interactive. When you visit a website and see things like slideshows, forms that check your input, or buttons that change color when you hover over them, that's usually JavaScript at work.

Why JavaScript?

- Interactivity: Makes websites interactive with features like image sliders, form validations, and dynamic content updates.

- Client-Side Execution: Runs directly in the browser, providing fast and responsive user experiences without needing to reload the page.

- Dynamic Content: Updates web content in real-time, such as loading new posts on social media feeds without refreshing the page.

- Versatile Libraries: Offers powerful tools and libraries (like React and jQuery) that simplify complex web development tasks.

- Cross-Platform: Works across different platforms, allowing you to build web, mobile, and desktop applications with the same language.

Now what to do to get JavaScript?
Nothing. You don't have to get or download JavaScript. JavaScript already runs in your browser on your computer, on your tablet, and on your smart-phone.
