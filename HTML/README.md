HTML
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a markup language used to create documents.
It provides the basic building blocks for web pages, allowing you to define the structure and layout of a document.

In HTML5, the DOCTYPE declaration is very simple and looks like this:
<!DOCTYPE html>

How HTML works with a browser?

1. Request and Response:
The browser requests the HTML document from a web server.
The server responds with the HTML file.

2. Parsing HTML:
The browser reads the HTML and builds the Document Object Model (DOM), a structured representation of the document.

3. Applying CSS:
CSS is loaded and parsed to style the elements in the DOM.

4. Layout and Rendering:
The browser calculates the layout of elements (reflow) and then paints the pixels on the screen.

5. Executing JavaScript:
JavaScript is loaded and executed, which can modify the DOM and CSS, leading to updates on the screen.

6. Handling User Interactions:
The browser listens for user actions (like clicks) and updates the page accordingly.

#HTML Tags
We have various HTML tags that can be used to display text on our HTML web page.
Starting with:

1. <p>: Paragraph
2. <h1>: Heading level 1
3. <h2>: Heading level 2
4. <h3>: Heading level 3
5. <h4>: Heading level 4
5. <h5>: Heading level 5
6. <h6>: Heading level 6
7. <strong>: Strong importance (usually bold)
8. <em>: Emphasized text (usually italic)
9. <u>: Underlined text
10. <sub>: Subscript text
11. <sup>: Superscript text
12. <blockquote>: Long quotation
13. <abbr>: Abbreviation
14. <br>: Line break
15. <span>: Generic inline container

#Inline VS Block Elements

In HTML, elements are categorized as either block-level elements or inline elements based on their default display behavior and layout characteristics.
Block-level elements occupy the full width of their parent container and always start on a new line, thereby creating a block of content. They can contain other block-level elements as well as inline elements, making them ideal for structuring the main sections of a webpage. Common block-level elements include div, p, h1 to h6, and ul.
On the other hand, inline elements only take up as much width as necessary for their content and do not start on a new line, allowing them to sit within a line of text alongside other inline elements. They are typically used for small pieces of content within block-level elements, such as links, emphasized text, and images. Common inline elements include span, a, strong, and img.

#div in HTML:
The div element, short for "division," is a fundamental block-level element in HTML used to group and organize other elements within a webpage. It is often used as a container for various content sections, providing structure and layout control.
