HTML
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a markup language used to create documents.
It provides the basic building blocks for web pages, allowing you to define the structure and layout of a document.

In HTML5, the DOCTYPE declaration is very simple and looks like this:
<!DOCTYPE html>

How HTML works with a browser?

1. Request and Response:
The browser requests the HTML document from a web server.
The server responds with the HTML file.

2. Parsing HTML:
The browser reads the HTML and builds the Document Object Model (DOM), a structured representation of the document.

3. Applying CSS:
CSS is loaded and parsed to style the elements in the DOM.

4. Layout and Rendering:
The browser calculates the layout of elements (reflow) and then paints the pixels on the screen.

5. Executing JavaScript:
JavaScript is loaded and executed, which can modify the DOM and CSS, leading to updates on the screen.

6. Handling User Interactions:
The browser listens for user actions (like clicks) and updates the page accordingly.
